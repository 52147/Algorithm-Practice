Precomputation arrays belong to the category of **optimization techniques** in algorithms. They are used to store results of expensive calculations or repetitive operations to avoid redundant computations during the execution of the main algorithm, thus improving efficiency and reducing time complexity.

Here are some common uses of precomputation arrays in algorithms:

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Storing intermediate results to avoid recomputing them, which is a key feature in dynamic programming.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**: Used to quickly compute the sum of elements in a range, by precomputing cumulative sums.

3. **Sparse Tables**: Used in range query problems like range minimum queries (RMQ), where precomputed tables allow for constant-time query answering.

4. **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**: Efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums.

5. **Hash Tables**: For storing precomputed results to provide constant-time access to those results.

6. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Precomputing prime numbers up to a certain limit for quick prime factorization or primality testing.

These precomputation techniques can significantly reduce the computational complexity of algorithms, especially in cases where the same subproblems or operations need to be solved multiple times.
