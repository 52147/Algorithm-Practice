### Precomputation Arrays: Time and Space Complexity

Precomputation arrays are an optimization technique used to improve the efficiency of algorithms by storing results of expensive calculations or repetitive operations. This can significantly reduce the computational complexity of algorithms. Below is an analysis of the time and space complexities associated with various precomputation techniques:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) to \(O(n^2)\) for most problems, depending on the specific problem and the number of subproblems.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) to \(O(n^2)\) for storing intermediate results.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - Precomputation: \(O(n)\)
     - Query: \(O(1)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the prefix sums.

3. **Sparse Tables**:
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - Precomputation: \(O(n \log n)\)
     - Query: \(O(1)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) for storing the precomputed ranges.

4. **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**:
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - Update: \(O(\log n)\)
     - Query: \(O(\log n)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the tree structure.

5. **Hash Tables**:
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - Insertion: \(O(1)\) average case
     - Query: \(O(1)\) average case
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the hash table.

6. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log \log n)\) for precomputing primes up to \(n\).
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing boolean values indicating primality.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - **Use Case**: Problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
   - **Examples**: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Increasing Subsequence.
   - **Optimization**: Avoids recomputation by storing intermediate results.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - **Use Case**: Range sum queries.
   - **Examples**: Range Sum Query (LeetCode 303), Range Sum Query 2D.
   - **Optimization**: Precomputes cumulative sums for quick range sum calculations.

3. **Sparse Tables**:
   - **Use Case**: Static range queries (i.e., the array does not change after preprocessing).
   - **Examples**: Range Minimum Query (RMQ).
   - **Optimization**: Allows for constant-time range queries after logarithmic-time preprocessing.

4. **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**:
   - **Use Case**: Dynamic range sum queries and point updates.
   - **Examples**: Range Sum Query - Mutable (LeetCode 307), Count of Smaller Numbers After Self.
   - **Optimization**: Efficiently updates elements and calculates prefix sums.

5. **Hash Tables**:
   - **Use Case**: Storing precomputed results or frequency counts.
   - **Examples**: Two Sum (LeetCode 1), Subarray Sum Equals K (LeetCode 560).
   - **Optimization**: Provides constant-time access to precomputed results.

6. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - **Use Case**: Precomputing prime numbers up to a certain limit.
   - **Examples**: Count Primes (LeetCode 204), Prime Factorization.
   - **Optimization**: Efficiently precomputes prime numbers to allow quick prime-related queries.

By precomputing results and storing them in arrays, these techniques reduce the time complexity of repetitive operations at the cost of additional space complexity. This trade-off is beneficial in scenarios where query operations need to be performed frequently, making precomputation a powerful tool in algorithm optimization.
